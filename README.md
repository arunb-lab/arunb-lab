# 👋 Hi, I’m Arun

I am a Computer Science teacher with a strong interest in software engineering and problem-solving. My work focuses on building **clear, reliable programs**, understanding systems from the fundamentals upward, and writing code that is easy to read, test, and maintain.

Teaching has shaped the way I think about software. I value simplicity, careful reasoning, and solutions that can be clearly explained to others.

## 🧩 What I Work On
- Backend services with clearly defined APIs  
- Algorithmic utilities and scheduling or logic-driven tools  
- Educational projects that convert theory into practical applications  

I prefer to complete a small number of projects properly rather than maintain many unfinished experiments.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Strengthening data structures and algorithms using Python  
- Building a production-quality flagship project  
- Improving code quality through testing and continuous integration
